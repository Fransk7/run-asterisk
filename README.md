# Run\*

### What is Run\*
Run\* is a program that can run other programs. You enter in the name of the program you would like
to run (like this: program.exe) and then that is added to the list of programs to be ran. You can also
have certain programs have priority over others in the list. You can give a program priority by adding
an asterisk to the end of its name (like this: program.exe\*). If it has priority it will be added to
the top of the list. I suppose, think of it like an assembly line. Things are being added to the end of
the assembly line, but sometimes you add something to the front of the line because it is more important
than the other things in the line and needs to be assembled first. (Just in this case we aren't assembling
anything, we're running programs on a computer.)

Run\* can also be used to read programs, with priority.

Run\* is also my first project in C++. I used it as a way to learn some C++, which wasn't too difficult
because it is very similar to Java (the language I know the best). I also made the project in one day which
makes me happy. (It's always nice to be able to make a project in a day or another short amount of time.)
